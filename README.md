# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is an e-commerce data analysis tool that uses a Python script to scrape product information from a single online marketplace. The primary goal is to perform a one-time data collection to capture a snapshot of current product prices, discounts, and ratings. The analysis focuses on brand competitiveness and product value rather than tracking historical changes.

***

## Files
* `products_jumia.csv`: This CSV file is the dataset generated by the web scraping script. It contains the raw data used for the analysis.
* `matplotvisual.py`: This Python script reads the `products_jumia.csv` file, performs data cleaning, and generates several plots using the `matplotlib` library to visualize the results.

***

## Questions Answered by the Analysis
The project's visualizations are designed to answer the following questions:

1.  **Which brand has the lowest average product price?**
    * This is shown in a bar chart plotting the average price for each brand.
2.  **What is the average discount percentage across all products in the dataset?**
    * This is visualized with a pie chart representing the total average discount.
3.  **Which brands have the highest average discount percentage?**
    * This is shown in a bar chart plotting the average discount percentage for each brand.
4.  **Is the rating worth the price?**
    * This is a scatter plot that shows the relationship between a product's price and its rating.
5.  **What is the reliability of each brand based on the average rating?**
    * This is visualized in a bar chart that compares the average ratings across different brands.
